---Simpson---

This function takes two input vectors and approximates the intergral using simpsons method and trapezoidal method if necessary.

---Usage---

Inputs:

x -Matrix of x values
y -Matrix of y values

Outputs:

I -Intergral approximation

---Issues---

You can not input a function and limits of intergration, only a table of values from a function. 
The values for each table must also be equally spaced for the function to run.
