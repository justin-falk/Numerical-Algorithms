# Numerical Algorithms from Spring 2018
The files in this repository are from Dr. Bechara's mech 105 class in the spring of 2018. The purpose of these files was to explore the various basic numerical methods used for engineering applications. These functions range from applications of Simpson's Method to using LU-factorization.

## Intended Use
These files are intended to be used for evaluating various problems without wasting time and potential accuracy by doing them by hand. It also allows for easy changes to made in order to fit specific needs.
