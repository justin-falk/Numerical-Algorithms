---False Position---

This function uses the false position method to approximate the roots of input functions around a certain set of initial points.

---Usage---

Inputs:

* func -Function that the users wishes to approximate the root of
* xl -Lower value of where the root search begins
* xu -The upper value of where the root search stops
* es -Desired error of the approximation
* iter -Number of iterations performed

Outputs:

* root -Root approximation
* fx -Function evaluated at the root
* ea -Approximate relative error
* iter -Number of iteeration performed

---Issues---

Does not converge to a root for some functions and initial values
