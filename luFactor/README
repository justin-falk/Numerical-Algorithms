---LU-Factor---

This function find the lu-factorization of an input matrix along with the associated pivot matrix.

---Usage---

Inputs:

* a -Square matrix for lu-decomposition

Outputs:

* l -Lower triangular matrix of a
* u -Upper triangular matrix of a
* p -Pivot matrix of a

---Issues---

L is not an accurate lower triangluar matrix. The P matrix does not update correctly. Fails with larger matrixes.
